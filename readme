This project allows one to generate distributions in network and find the best 
local model approaching these distributions with a neural network based method.

Project made by Massi Rashidi and Antoine Girardin.

The file main_generate_distributions.py computes distributions for given 
networks, measurements and states.

The file main_find_local_models.py run the neural network to find the best local model.

The file main_read_results.py reads the model found in main_find_local_models.py.

The file get_precomputed_results.py reads the results obtained previously.
